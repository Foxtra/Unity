# Flappy Bird

This project was made using [Unity tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/live-session-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game)

The Bird flyes to the right and the goal is to avoid collisions with columns and ground 
(actually the background and columns are moving to the left).

The Bird is constantly going down and it goes up only when the player clicks Left Mouse Button.

The project contains two forlders: *Release* and *Source*:

- Release folder contains build for PC.
- Source folder contains Unity 2019.2.9f1 project.
